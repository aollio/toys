"""
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.


Example 1:

Input: 2
Output:  2
Explanation:  There are two ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output:  3
Explanation:  There are three ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
